# Comprehensive Free Resources for Self-Study in Classical Chinese

This resource page compiles high-quality, freely available online materials for learning **Classical Chinese** (文言文). Resources are organized by practical learning categories to support progressive skill development: building vocabulary, mastering grammar, engaging in extensive reading, practicing composition, and understanding cultural/historical context.
