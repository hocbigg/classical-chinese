# Summary

The Classical Chinese curriculum is a **complete education in Classical Chinese (文言文)** using online materials. The program aims to build proficiency equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate foundation in Sinology or Chinese classics, condensed into **1–2 years** at ~20 hours/week.

The focus is on reading comprehension, grammatical mastery, textual analysis, and cultural/historical context, with balanced attention to theory (grammar and philology), practice (translation and reading), and synthesis (interpretation and application).

**The resource page** can be found here: [classical-chinese/resources](resources.md). 

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
