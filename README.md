# Summary

The Classical Chinese curriculum is a complete education in Classical Chinese (文言文) using online materials.

The focus is on reading comprehension, grammatical mastery, textual analysis, and cultural/historical context, with balanced attention to theory (grammar and philology), practice (translation and reading), and synthesis (interpretation and application).

The resource page can be found here: [classical-chinese/resources](resources.md). 

## Organization

This repository is organized into 2 main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core

These four sections form the essential foundation. Work through them one after another — do not skip or jump ahead.

1. I. Foundations of Classical Chinese  
   Start here. This part teaches you how to read and understand the language itself.

2. II. Core Classical Chinese Texts  
   Next, read the most influential early texts that shaped the entire tradition. Finish both subsections (3 and 4) before moving on.

3. III. Literary Culture  
   Then move into the major literary forms (poetry and prose). Complete both subsections (5 and 6).

4. IV. Later Intellectual Traditions (only the first subsection: Song Thought)  
   Finish the curriculum by studying how the earlier ideas were reinterpreted in later centuries. Read the “Song Thought” part of section 7.

Once you have completed this Core path, you will have a coherent, well-rounded understanding of Classical Chinese language, major texts, literary tradition, and its intellectual development — equivalent to the core of an undergraduate major.

### Advanced

After finishing the Core path, choose one or both of the following tracks depending on your interests:

- Advanced Daoism (the second part of section 7): Choose this track if you are especially drawn to philosophical imagination, paradox, and non-Confucian ways of thinking.
- Deeper focus on poetry: Return to section 5 and read more widely in Tang poetry (or continue with other poets) if you love concise, emotional, and imagistic writing.
