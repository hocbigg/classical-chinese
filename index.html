<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>The Classical Chinese curriculum is a complete education in Classical Chinese (文言文) using online materials.</p>
<p>The focus is on reading comprehension, grammatical mastery, textual analysis, and cultural/historical context, with balanced attention to theory (grammar and philology), practice (translation and reading), and synthesis (interpretation and application).</p>
<p>The resource page can be found here: <a href="resources.html">classical-chinese/resources</a>. </p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
<p>This repository is organized into 2 main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Curriculum</strong> (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;</li>
<li><strong><a href="advanced_topics.html">Advanced Topics</a></strong>: focused study in specific areas;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process:</strong> Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.</p>
<ul>
<li>For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.</li>
<li>The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.</li>
<li>Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in <a href="extras/courses.html">extras/courses</a>, <a href="extras/readings.html">extras/readings</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-curriculum">How to use this curriculum</h2>
<h3 id="core">Core</h3>
<p>These four sections form the essential foundation. Work through them one after another — do not skip or jump ahead.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I. Foundations of Classical Chinese<br />
   Start here. This part teaches you how to read and understand the language itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>II. Core Classical Chinese Texts<br />
   Next, read the most influential early texts that shaped the entire tradition. Finish both subsections (3 and 4) before moving on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>III. Literary Culture<br />
   Then move into the major literary forms (poetry and prose). Complete both subsections (5 and 6).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IV. Later Intellectual Traditions (only the first subsection: Song Thought)<br />
   Finish the curriculum by studying how the earlier ideas were reinterpreted in later centuries. Read the “Song Thought” part of section 7.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have completed this Core path, you will have a coherent, well-rounded understanding of Classical Chinese language, major texts, literary tradition, and its intellectual development — equivalent to the core of an undergraduate major.</p>
<h3 id="advanced">Advanced</h3>
<p>After finishing the Core path, choose one or both of the following tracks depending on your interests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced Daoism (the second part of section 7): Choose this track if you are especially drawn to philosophical imagination, paradox, and non-Confucian ways of thinking.</li>
<li>Deeper focus on poetry: Return to section 5 and read more widely in Tang poetry (or continue with other poets) if you love concise, emotional, and imagistic writing.</li>
</ul>
